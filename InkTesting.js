But perhaps we still have not found the best way for him to learn yet, Mary says.","\n","^\"Additionally,” she continues, “many studies show that it is critical for schools and parents to understand how to enhance students' motivation for learning. Usually, if students are learning passively, they can only retain a maximum of 30% of knowledge from a book. Therefore, we should encourage children to learn actively, such as playing educational games. The reason we suggest parents consider educational games is that not only do they work academically, they are tremendously enjoyable for the children. So, they can immersivity play games and learn while doing it. In addition to helping your child learn actively, parents should pay more attention to their child's physical and mental development and pay more attention to their emotions. It all helps to enhance their learning,\" Mary says.","\n","^\"I see. Thank you, Mary.
